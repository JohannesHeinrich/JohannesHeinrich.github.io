      <description>Chronic Intensity Load, CIL (1st/half) A newer parameter to measure Training Load based on the Intensity Factor. The Chronic Intensity Factor, CIL, tells how hard a session was relative to the threshold power. Intensity Factor is an option to measure training stress exclusive of duration as length of a training session is not always key to success. The CIL is not a replacement for the CTL it complements.
Above Red Line: Indicates a relative high intensity Between Red and Green Line: Bandwidth for rather normal training intensities Below Green Line: Indicates a relative low intensity Acute Chronic Workload Ratio, ACWR (2nd/half) The Acute Chronic Workload Ratio, ACWR, shall be used to help predicting and indicating injury risks by calculating the ratio between Acute Chronic Workload, performed over the past 7 days, and the Chronic Training Load.</description>

      <description>Data Hub Since I migrated to Intervals.icu, it acts as #mytrainingplanning central data hub. Intervals.icu can connect to the most relevant sport platforms and syncs recorded sessions automatically from there. The platform is also capable of dealing with all kind of data which are recorded during a training session. Strava has its limits.
Personal Diary Still, all activities get uploaded to Strava as it is great to use for personal diary reasons.</description>

      <guid>https://www.johannesheinrich.de/mytrainingplanning/features/distribution-category/</guid>
      <description>Training sessions for biking and running become classified in the training library with good fitting categories like: #5 Speed/Tech Skills or #9 Run off the Bike. They are all listed top left. Those categories are perfect for running reports like: how much time I spent in each. Actually a very good &amp;ldquo;controller&amp;rdquo; if the training happened widely spread according to my strategy and principles.
Small side note regarding swimming, as this discipline is listed under #12 Swim.</description>

      <description>1-12-365 a sheer massiv amount of events should, could and will happen. It has to be structured, otherwise I turn lost in circles. There are some #mytrainingplanning places where different events being maintained to be reused over and over based on needs.
Google Calendar Integration for Day Events This one is actually a nice und hidden integration into my Google Calendar. All day events I maintain and optionally hashtag in my Google Calendar are showing up automatically in many diagrams and at central planning views.</description>

      <description>Heartrate(s) The top line is nothing more than the most recent maximum measured HR in the last 30 days. The dark red line reflects a rolling HR maximum average per training session from the last 30 days including a predition based on already planned training sessions. The dark red line is surfaced with a historical and upcoming trend zone to reflect maximum HR stress. The red line reflects a rolling HR average per training session from the last 30 days including a prediction based on already planned training sessions.</description>

      <description>W Prime In bordeaux red, the line is my highest calculated W Prime (W’) value from the rolling last 30 days to indicate the level of anaerobic capacity performance.
Heartrate Recovery HRRc, which is measured during the training session itself is a very old, but golden recovery indicator. It helps me to monitoring training status over longer periods of time. How rapidly my heart rate drops form the given threshold to baseline after hard efforts provides an excellent index about my overall freshness both during workouts and also over longer periods for recovery.</description>

      <description>Next 3 upcoming days What do I want to train next now? What´s again the session in detail? Can I get it onto my sports watch?
I need a simple way to see what´s on #mytrainingplanning air next. It´s enough to get todays training session, but with all details: pace, wattage, duration, intensity and so on. And if I have one, a Garmin Training, it is helpful to push this training easy to my sports watch not loosing to much time in the Garmin universe.</description>

      <description>This is the most important area where all #mytrainingplanning is happening.
Planning my training sessions Basically the following steps are happening:
1st) Day Intensity
Not all days are equal. I am following a certain training pattern with build and lighter days. I need this small but very important information to start structuring and applying week pattern, which is especially for longer build periods of the year very useful.
2nd) Planning Training Sessions</description>

      <description>A Season Each of my seasons has basically five periods with different lengths. It´s fine for me to set its length based on weeks. (see top left)
The Weeks Once done with the seasonal periods it becomes more concrete. (see right area) I apply per week a certain focus plus maintain centrally my planned availability per week. This input is used at many other #mytrainingplanning places to support planning and strive for the right focus.</description>

      <description>Run &amp;amp; Bike The following diagram is available for Bike and Run as nowerdays Wattage and Power numbers being recorded for both disciplines.
Power Load The 1st top section highlights the FTP section: This reflects the lastests results measured through tests and the most plus the recent calculated FTP since the last 30 days. The dark brown line reflects a rolling maximum Power average per training session from the last 30 days including a predition based on already planned training sessions.</description>

      <description>The sport specific distribution reports me per each discipline how much time I spent on each the last weeks. It also shows me how much time I plan to spend on the upcoming weeks up to the entire season.
I really need this simple visualisation to have an overview for the upcoming weeks especially for planning reasons. It helps to verify that a proper distribution is considered as I wanted to have it.</description>

      <description>When planning a season immediately the need to look things up from the past rised. It helps to learn, adapt and to become a better version of my own. All the mistakes, all the s*** and all the great results from the past are small puzzle pieces and enabler for making the future more shinny than ever.
I simply pick the year and the month which I wanna look back and its upcoming 12 months being opened.</description>

      <description>Biweekly Intensity Pattern I follow a training approach of build and lighter days. For this reason I developed roughly a handful of biweekly patterns I leverage across a season depending on its period and the required load.
Weekly Sport Pattern Basically the same as from above applies to the weekly sport pattern. Depending on the needs for different periods from the season I follow and reuse structures from those.</description>

      <description>Swimming becomes an individual part in #mytrainingplanning As swimming becomes easily rather complex to plan and structure for triathlon training I decided to develop for this discipline an individual tool inside #mytrainingplanning. It´s fairly easy to understand: each swim training isn´t just go swimming and you´re done, it´s more. Think of my swim planner like a puzzle maximum up to 5 pieces per each session. Each of those 5 piece can be picked and choosen from the underlaying swim library.</description>

      <guid>https://www.johannesheinrich.de/mytrainingplanning/features/time-score/</guid>
      <description>Yes, I know thinking in weeks isn´t good as training progress does not necessarily need to happen just with weeks. Unfortunately most of us being forced to get used to weeks as we´re working for some days plus having weekend days with slightly more or a maximum amount of time available. So, yes, thinking in weeks makes or can make sense.
I see my available hours (lightest grey), my planned hours (not the lightest grey), my trained hours (the black ones) plus the sum of my weekly training load.</description>

      <guid>https://www.johannesheinrich.de/mytrainingplanning/features/timeline-custom/</guid>
      <description>This is an individual view.
The seasonal view is too much when planning concretely the next days or weeks. For this reason and as for individual purpose the amount of days from the past plus the upcoming days can be set.</description>

      <description>This is the seasonal view.
Beside the planning this is potentially the most important diagram which calculates and displays the most important KPIs which are required for #mytrainingplanning.
Fitness Charts (1st/third) The classical part of the chart:
Red line: ATL &amp;ldquo;Acute Training Load assumes fatigue from the most recent training load&amp;rdquo;. Green line: CTL &amp;ldquo;Chronic Training Load reflects fitness which is built over a longer period of time&amp;rdquo;. The predictable part of the chart:</description>

      <description>This is standard for training planning tools. Each athlete sets the zones differently, I do the same for me. Individual zone settings for each discipline for up to seven zones. Once done each hr, pace or power change gets automatically derived from individual test results and pushed to #mytrainingplanning sessions in the training libraries.
The small diagrams at the bottom indicate and help tracking the progress of test results.</description>

      <description>Maximum level of flexibility My #mytrainingplanning library is made to start super simple, grown steady over the time with a maximum level of flexibility for all my bike, run or strength training sessions. The creamy cherry on the lemon cake is the individual usage of all my Pacing&amp;amp;Racing zone parameters like heartrate, pace or power thresholds which are being adjusted to each need of a dedicated training session.
Some key assets: When building up such an individual training library categorization become a central component as reports being generated with this meta information.</description>

      <description>Swim Library Puzzle For the discipline swimming an individual tool inside #mytrainingplanning got developed. This tooling is like a small puzzle maximum up to 5 pieces per each training session which can be picked from this underlaying swim library.
Beside several categorizing options, like session types or when´s the best point in time during a season to plan with this one, there is also a calculation for the intensity based on my current trainingzones for swimming.</description>
