<h1>DIY Training Planning - A free training planning tool for competitive Age-Groupers and for Pros!</h1>
<p>DIY. A free endurance training tool for triathlon, biking or running made for competitive Age-Groupers plus, why not also, for Pros.</p>
<h1 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h1>
<p>It gets touted as the &ldquo;key&rdquo; to become a better version of yourself. It promises you performing on a higher level as before. It serves individual training concepts based on a promised constant dialogue between you, the athlete, and them, the coach. This stands on the paper. This is what is being bought.<br>
After years of enjoying such well &ldquo;athlete-coach-relationships&rdquo; served through really bad training tools I personally reached a conclusion where I can most definitely say:<br>
First, there is too much bad and overrated software in the market which does not serve the scenarios you are basically looking for as an athlete to plan your individual training based on your most recent training load. And really good things do not have to cost anything. At the end it´s not the tool, the software, which makes you better. It´s about the people using it.<br>
Which brings me to my second point: No one else knows you better than you. And no one else might be a better coach than you could ever be. At least you should be enabled with the right tooling, this is the absolute minium to start your training and doing the things you love: train, eat, sleep and repeat.</p>
<h1 id="my-needs-my-reqs">My needs, my reqs</h1>
<h2 id="start-doing">Start doing</h2>
<p><em>I want to train, eat, sleep and repeat.</em><br>
<em>I want to plan my indivdual training based on my individual performance and my individual training load.</em><br>
<em>I want so stay flexible with my training sessions on a daily basis with the option to reflect a seasonal strategy along my individual goals.</em>
<em>I want to leverage a given combination of tooling which is for most of athletes anyway available, which is Strava.</em></p>
<h2 id="stopped-already">Stopped already</h2>
<p><em>I don´t want to be in an athlete-coach-relationship.</em><br>
<em>I am not willing to pay money for software which doesn´t serve me with all my basic needs I am looking for.</em></p>
<h1 id="idea">Idea</h1>
<p>I just followed the principle &ldquo;If it´s not on STRAVA, it did not happen!&rdquo;. So, if it´s on STRAVA data should be there and could get leveraged. Why also not reusing what it already there.</p>
